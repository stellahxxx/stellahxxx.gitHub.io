<p>Facebook and Google are accused of having policies in place that make it difficult for adaptive clothing brands targeting customers with disabilities.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Adaptive fashion is dealing with an unexpected hurdle in reaching customers on Facebook, Instagram and Google, where advertising policies and algorithms are rejecting ads placed by adaptive-wear brands, according to founders and marketers.</p>
<p>Maria O’Sullivan-Abeyratne, director of adaptive-wear marketplace Adaptista, says her company and the brands she carries on her site have been unable to target customers on Facebook using paid ads because the ads include words such as “disability” or “elderly”, and the images include people with wheelchairs or prosthetic limbs. Sullivan-Abeyratne says based on conversations with Facebook via email and phone, the reason comes down to AI error and a lack of training for manual reviewers around disability content that is safe versus harmful.</p>
<p>Facebook’s advertising policy bans personal attributes including disabilities and medical conditions from being featured in advertisements. Facebook states these review processes are in place to “help protect people from poor ad experiences, and help to support more meaningful connections between people and businesses”. Facebook advertising policies, which extend to Instagram ads, rely primarily on automated technology to apply their policies to the millions of ads which run across their apps. Facebook’s guidelines say certain contexts including these attributes do not violate its policies, but content that is not harmful is being swept up by the algorithm too. </p>
<p>Emerging adaptive wear brands like Slick Chicks have also had <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/COVEJV_qnoJ/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link">advertisements removed</a> on Instagram and Facebook, which cite violation of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.facebook.com/communitystandards/">community standards</a> as the reason. They also had images flagged for containing inappropriate content. The images were of women modelling their adaptive underwear in wheelchairs. </p>
<p>“We asked Facebook and Instagram for support several times without any success,” says Slick Chicks founder and CEO Helya Mohammadian. “It was now harder to reach our followers or people and communities that might need our products. Being a small business, we survive and thrive off of our community and reaching people who need this product via social media.” Mohammadian says she’s dealt with intermittent bans and has started petitions to reverse them.</p>
<p>For new business owners, frequent appeals processes following bans with vague reasoning behind them is time consuming and costly.</p>
<p>Sullivan-Abeyratne says she lost £1000 when she tried to promote her market research survey for Adaptista, an initiative to gather information about adaptive wear consumer needs. Sullivan-Abeyratne paid a marketing agency to create completely accessible adverts and had the images tested for inclusion by a consultant, ensuring people with synesthesia and colour blindness could comfortably view the ads. As the ads were promptly banned, there was no return on Adaptista’s investment.</p>
<p>In a statement to <em>Vogue Business</em>, a Facebook spokesperson said: “Our ads and commerce review systems use automated, and in some cases, manual review, to check content against our advertising and commerce policies. Enforcement is never perfect, and our enforcement team is constantly working to improve our review processes to improve both the accuracy of review and to provide a good experience for users.”</p>
<p>With 2.8 billion users, Facebook’s potential for building brand awareness is significant, and according to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.coherentmarketinsights.com/market-insight/adaptive-clothing-market-2294">Coherent Market Insights</a>, the global market for <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.voguebusiness.com/consumers/adaptive-clothing-differently-abled-asos-target-tommy-hilfiger">adaptive clothing is expected to be worth $400 billion</a> by 2026 compared to $279 billion in 2017. However, when small, independent brands have content removed from the major platforms, their growth is stunted and the stigma surrounding disability and medical problems is perpetuated, say analysts. </p>
<p>“An organic social media strategy can work, but it will take a lot longer. Social media is a numbers game: you’re reaching a much larger audience [with paid social],” says Phoebe Dodds, founder of digital marketing consultancy Buro155. Losing access to paid social tools makes marketing that much harder, especially if they’re targeting Gen Z. “By cutting off certain brands from their audiences, it reduces their growth opportunities, limiting them to what they can achieve offline and organically,” says Dodd.</p>
<h6 id="Finding-alternatives"><a href="#Finding-alternatives" class="headerlink" title="Finding alternatives"></a><strong>Finding alternatives</strong></h6><p>When Miga Swimwear launched a collection for women with disfigurements, disabilities and chronic illnesses in 2019, founder Maria Luisa Mendiola set aside over 30 per cent of the brand’s marketing budget for Facebook and Instagram. Ultimately, its Facebook account was banned from retargeting audiences and using the Facebook shopping catalogue because the website and brand messaging included medical terms like “colitis” and “sacrococcygeal teratoma”. Mendiola says she was also banned from remarketing, a tool that allows business owners to strategically position ads in front of targeted audiences as they browse Google, also because of the mentioned medical terms on the Miga site. Google did not respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>The Facebook spokesperson said that in this instance, the ads were removed erroneously. “We want to help adaptive fashion brands find and connect with customers on Facebook. A small number of Miga Swimwear products were mistakenly rejected by our systems in May, for violating our nudity policies and have since been restored. We apologise for this mistake and are working to improve our systems so that brands don’t run into these issues in the future.” </p>
<p>Sullivan-Abeyratne of Adaptista claims Facebook has approved, banned, reinstated and re-banned the same adverts featuring disabled models and/or copywriting mentioning disability frequently. They have received written apologies from Facebook and been able to use their advertising account on occasion, but this is usually short-lived and Sullivan-Abeyratne finds herself repeatedly appealing Adaptista advertising bans. </p>
<p>Facebook said ads by Adaptista were incorrectly rejected for violating unacceptable business practices policy and says these ads have since been reenabled. Adaptista says some ads were initially re-enabled, but were banned and removed from the platform since. Sullivan-Abeyratne has reached out to Facebook numerous times over the same adverts. </p>
<p>There are ways to work around the rules, but they require a more discrete approach to the marketing. American fashion brand Tommy Hilfiger is growing its <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.voguebusiness.com/fashion/tommy-hilfiger-ramps-up-adaptive-fashion-whos-next">adaptive fashion collection</a> by making it available in more countries and adding product offerings every season. Most of the brand’s marketing is focused on digital and social media. “We know that this is where adaptive consumers do the majority of their shopping due to difficulties in physical stores,” says senior director of innovation and integrated marketing Sarah Horton. </p>
<p>Unlike others, Tommy has not met blockers from social media algorithms or violations of terms of service, because rather than focusing on disability or specific conditions, its wording has focused on other categories such as health and wellness, technology and innovative fashion, according to Horton. Copywriting and supporting imagery are solution-led and focused on ease, access, and moving towards a simpler future with dressing. The brand also uses advertisements like the below Speakable ad, which targets non-disabled people and encourages them to think about people with disabilities and their clothing needs.</p>
<p>However, this brings up ethical problems. Some adaptive wear brand owners, including Adaptista and Miga, say they do not want to censor the word “disabled” or specific medical conditions or disability terms from their copywriting and imagery, especially as many themselves are disabled.</p>
<p>Brands are hoping that Facebook and other tech platforms will change their stance and review its artificial intelligence to better understand nuances in content about people with disabilities. In the short term, influencers can fill the void.</p>
<p>After the issues with Facebook persisted, Miga’s Mendiola hired a creative agency who developed a marketing strategy prioritising influencers. The brand now works with 15. They’ve also decided to split their targeted marketing and focus on disabled people and able-bodied consumers. </p>
<p>“We are working with influencers who have disabilities, influencers who are new mums - another demographic we wanted to reach - as well as influencers who are more interested in the sustainability aspect of our swimwear,” says Mendiola. She’s also investing more in TikTok, which she says is paying off well. Though it’s too early for Mendiola to assess how TikTok is impacting conversions, she says her time invested into the platform is creating community and awareness.</p>
<p>Mendiola also uses in-person events and pop-up shops to share those stories, but the Covid-19 pandemic has this on pause. The messaging appears on packaging instead, with each product coming in a canvas bag printed with a customer’s story.</p>
<p>Phoebe Dodds notes that without paid social media tools at play, it’s extremely difficult for brands to grow, especially startups. There’s also a wider, accessibility issue at play when tech giants’ algorithms do not work for brand advertising featuring disabilities. “It disadvantages [adaptive wear’s] intended customers. The onus shouldn’t be on brands to change their language to fit social media platforms’ arbitrary algorithms - we’ve got a long way to go with inclusivity on social media, both in terms of the content, and the tech itself,” says Dodds.</p>
