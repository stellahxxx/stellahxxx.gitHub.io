It used to pay very well to stage such great performances under one’s own management, but today that is quite impossible. We live in a different world now. At one time the whole town took a lively interest in the hunger artist; from day to day of his fast the excitement mounted; everybody wanted to see him at least once a day; there were people who bought season tickets for the last few days and sat from morning till night in front of his small barred cage; even in the nighttime there were visiting hours, when the whole effect was heightened by torch flares; on fine days the cage was set out in the open air, and then it was the children’s special treat to see the hunger artist; for their elders he was often just a joke that happened to be in fashion, but the children stood openmouthed, holding each other’s hands for greater security, marveling at him as he sat there pallid in black tights, with his ribs sticking out so prominently, not even on a seat but down among straw on the ground, sometimes giving a courteous nod, answering questions with a constrained smile, or perhaps stretching an arm through the bars so that one might feel how thin it was, and then again withdrawing deep into himself, paying no attention to anyone or anything, not even to the all-important striking of the clock that was the only piece of furniture in his cage, but merely staring into vacancy with half-shut eyes, now and then taking a sip from a tiny glass of water to moisten his lips.</p>
<p>Besides casual onlookers there were also relays of permanent watchers selected by the public, ususally butchers, strangely enough, and it was their task to watch the hunger artist day and night, three of them at a time, in case he should have some secret recourse to nourishment. This was nothing but a formality, instituted to reassure the masses, for the initiates knew well enough that during his fast the artist would never in any circumstances, not even under forcible compulsion, swallow the smallest morsel of food; the honor of his profession forbade it. Not every watcher, of course, was capable of understanding this, there were often groups of night watchers who were very lax in carrying out their duties and deliberately hudled together in a retired corner to play cards with great absorption, obviously intending to give the hunger artist the chance of a little refreshment, which they supposed he could draw from some private hoard. Nothing annoyed the artist more than such watchers; they made him miserable; they made his fast seem unendurable; sometimes he mastered his feebleness sufficiently to sing during their watch for as long as he could keep going, to show them how unjust their suspicions were. But that was of little use; they only wondered at his cleverness in being able to fill his mouth even while singing. Much more to his taste were the watchers who sat up close to the bars, who were not content with the dim night lighting of the hall but focused him in the full glare of the electric pocket torch given them by the impresario. The harsh light did not trouble him at all, in any case he could never sleep properly,and he could always drowse a little, even when the hall was thronged with noisy onlookers. He was quite happy at the prospect of spending a sleepless night with such watchers; he was ready to exchange jokes with them, to tell them stories out of his nomadic life, anything at all to keep them awake and demonstrate to them that he had no eatables in his cage and that he was fasting as not one of them could fast. But his happiest moment was when the morning came and an enormous breakfast was brought them, at his expense, on which they flung themselves wit hthe keen appetite of healthy men after a weary night of wakefulness. Of course there were people who argued that this breakfast was an unfair attempt to bribe the watchers, but that was going rather too far, and when they were invited to take on a night’s vigil without a breakfast, merely for the sake of the cause, they made themselves scarce, although they stuck stubbornly to their suspicions.</p>
<p>Such suspicions, anyhow, were a necessary accompaniment to the profession of fasting. No one could possibly watch the hunger artist continuosly, day and night, and so no one could produce first-hand evidence that the fast had really been rigorous and continuous; only the artist himself could know that, he was therefore bound to be the sole completely satisfied spectator of his own fast. Yet for other reasons he was never satisfied; it was not perhaps mere fasting that had brought him to such skeleton thinness that many people had regretfully to keep away from his exhibitions, because the sight of him was too much for them, perhaps it was dissatisfaction with himself that had worn him down. For he alone knew, what no other initiate knew, how easy it was to fast. It was the easiest thing in the world. He made no secret of this, yet people did not believe him. At the best they set him down as modest, most of them, however, thought he was out for publicity or else he was some kind of cheat who found it easy to fast because he had discovered a way of making it easy, and then had the impudence to admit the fact, more or less. He had to put up with all that, and in the course of time had got used to it, but his inner dissatisfaction always rankled, and never yet, after any term of fasting–this must be granted to his credit–had he left the cage of his own free will. The longest period of fasting was fixed by his impresario at forty days, beyond that term he was not allowed to go, not even in great cities, and there was good reason for it, too. Experience had proved that for about forty days the interest of the public could be stimulated by a steadily increasing pressure of advertisment, but after that the town began to lose interest, sympathetic support began notably to fall off, there were of course local variations as between one town and another, but as a general rule forty days marked the limit. So on the fortieth day the flower-bedecked cage was opened, enthusiastic spectators filled the hall, a military band played, two doctors entered the cage to measure the results of the fast, which were announced through a megaphone, and finally two young ladies appeared, blissful at having been selected for the honor, to help the hunger artist down the few steps leading to a small table on which was spread a carefully chosen invalid repast. And at this very moment the artist always turned stubborn. True, he would entrust his bony arms to the outstretched helping hands of the ladies bending over him, but stand up he would not. Why stop fasting at this particular moment, after forty days of it? He had held out for a long time, an illimitably long time; why stop now, when he was in his best fasting form, or rather, not yet quite in his best fasting form? Why should he be cheated of the fame he would get for fasting longer, for being not only the record hunger artist of all time, which presumably he was already, but for beating his own record by a performance beyond human imagination, since he felt that there were no limits to his capacity for fasting? His public pretended to admire him so much, why should it have so little patience with him; if he could endure fasting longer, why shouldn’t the public endure it? Besides, he was tired, and now he was supposed to lift himself to his full height and go down to a meal the very thought of which gave him a nausea that only the presence of the ladies kept him from betraying, and even that with an effort. And he looked up into the eyes of the ladies who were apparently so friendly and in reality so cruel, and shook his head, which felt too heavy on its strengthless neck. But then there happened yet again what always happened. The impresario came forward, without a word–for the band made speech impossible–lifted his arms in the air above the artist, as if inviting Heaven to look down upon its creature here in the straw, this suffering martyr, which indeed he was, although in quite another sense; grasped him around the emaciated waist, with exaggerated caution, so that the frail condition he was in might be appreciated; and committed him to the care of the blenching ladies, not without secretly giving him a shaking so that his legs and body tottered and swayed. The artist now submitted completely; his head lolled on his breast as if it had landed there by chance; his body was hollowed out; his legs in a spasm of self-preservation clung to each other at the knees, yet scraped on the ground as if it were not really solid ground, as if they were only trying to find solid ground; and the whole weight of his body, a featherweight after all, relapsed onto one of the ladies, who looking round for help and panting a little–this post of honor was not at all what she expected it to be–first stretched her neck as far as she could to keep her face at least free from contact with the artist, then finding this impossible, and her more fortunate companion not coming to her aid, but merely holding extended on her own trembling hand the little bunch of knucklebones that was the artist’s, to the great delight of the spectators burst into tears and had to be replaced by an attendant who had long been stationed in readiness. Then came the food, a little of which the impresario managed to get between the artist’s lips, while he sat in a kind of half-fainting trance, to the accompaniment of cheerful patter designed to distract the public’s attention from the artist’s condition; after that, a toast was drunk to the public, supposedly prompted by a whisper from the artist in the impresario’s ear; the band confirmed it with a mighty flourish, the spectators melted away, and no one had any cause to be dissatisfied with the proceedings, no one except the hunger artist himself, he only, as always.</p>
<p>So he lived for many years, with small regular intervals of recuperation, in visible glory, honored by all the world, yet in spite of that troubled in spirit, and all the more troubled because no one would take his trouble seriously. What comfort could he posibly need? What more could he possibly wish for? And if some good-natured person, feeling sorry for him, tried to console him by pointing out that his melancholy was probably caused by fasting, it could happen, especially when he had been fasting for some time, that he reacted with an outburst of fury and to the general alarm began to shake the bars of the cage like a wild animal. Yet the impresario had a way of punishing these outbreaks which he rather enjoyed putting into operation. He would apologize publicly for the artist’s behavior, which was only to be excused, he admitted, because of the irritability caused by fasting; a condition hardly to be understood by well-fed people; then by natural transition he went on to mention the artist’s equally incomprehensible boast that he could fast for much longer than he was doing; he praised the high ambition, the good will, the great self-denial undoubtedly implicit in such a statement; and then quite simply countered it by bringing out photographs, which were also on sale to the public, showing the artist on the fortieth day of a fast lying in bed almost dead from exhaustion. This perversion of the truth, familiar to the artist though it was, always unnerved him afresh and proved too much for him. What was a consequence of the premature ending of his fast was here presented as the cause of it! To fight against this lack of understanding, against a whole world of non-understanding, was impossible. Time and time again in good faith he stood by the bars listening to the impresario, but as soon as the photographs appeared he always let go and sank with a groan back on to his straw, and the reassured public could once more come close and gaze at him.</p>
<p>A few years later when the witnesses of such scenes called them to mind, they often failed to understand themselves at all. For meanwhile the aforementioned chance in public interest had set in; it seemed to happen almost overnight; there may have been profound causes for it, but who was going to bother about that; at any rate the pampered hunger artist suddenly found himself deserted one fine day by the amusement seekers, who went streaming past him to other more favored attractions. For the last time the impresario hurried him over half Europe to discover whether the old interest might still survive here and there; all in vain; everywhere, as if by secret agreement, a positive revulsion from professional fasting was in evidence. Of course it could not really have sprung up so suddenly as all that, and many premonitory symptoms which had not been sufficiently remarked or suppressed during the rush and glitter of success now came retrospectively to mind, but it was now too late to take any countermeasures. Fasting would surely come into fashion again at some future date, yet that was no comfort for those living in the present. What, then, was the hunger artist to do? He had been applauded by thousands in his time and could hardly come down to showing himself in a street booth at village fairs, and as for adopting another profession, he was not only too old for that but too fanatically devoted to fasting. So he took leave of the impresario, his partner in an unparalleled career, and hired himself to a large circus; in order to spare his own feelings he avoided reading the conditions of his contract.</p>
<p>A large circus with its enormous traffic in replacing and recruiting men, animals and apparatus can always find a use for people at any time, even for a hunger artist, provided of course that he does not ask too much., and in this particular case anyhow it was not only the artist who was taken on but his famous and long-known name as well, indeed considering the peculiar nature of his performance, which was not imparired by advancing age, it could not be objected that here was an artist past his prime, no longer at the height of his professional skill, seking a refuge in some quiet corner of a circus, on the contrary, the hunger artist averred that he could fast as well as ever, which was entirely credible, he even alleged that if he were allowed to fast as he liked, and this was at once promised him without more ado, he could astound the world by establishing a record never yet achieved, a statement which certainly provoked a smile among the other professionals, since it was left out of account the change in public opinion, which the hunger artist in his zeal conveniently forgot.</p>
<p>He had not, however, actually lost his sense of the real situation and took it as a matter of course that he and his cage should be stationed, not in the middle of the ring as a main attraction, but outside, near the animal cages, on a site that was after all easily accessible. Large and gaily painted placards made a frame for the cage and announced what was to be seen inside it. When the public came thronging out in the intervals to see the animals, they could harly avoid passing the hunger artist’s cage and stopping there a moment, perhaps they might even have stayed longer had not those pressing behind them in the narrow gangway, who did not understand why they should be held up on their way towards the excitements of the menagerie, made it impossible for anyone to stand gazing quietly for any length of time. And that was the reason why the hunger artist, who had of course been looking forward to these visiting hours as the main achievement of his life, began instead to shrink from them. At first he could hardly wait for the intervals; it was exhilirating to watch the crowds come streaming his way, until only too soon–not even the most obstinante self-deception, clung to almost consciously, could hold out against the fact–the conviction was borne in upon him that these people, most of them, to judge from their actions, again and again, without exception, were all on their way to the menagerie. And the first sight of them from the distance remained the best. For when they reached his cage he was at once deafened by the storm of shouting and abuse that arose from the two contending factions, which renewed themselves continuously, of those who wanted to stop and stare at him–he soon began to dislike them more than the others–not out of real interest but only out of obstinante self-assertiveness, and those who wanted to go straight on to the animals. When the first great rush was past, the stragglers came along, and these, whom nothing could have prevented from stopping to look at him as long as they had breath, raced past with long strides, hardly even glancing at him, in their haste to get to the menagerie in time. And all too rarely did it happen that he had a stroke of luck, when some father of a family fetched up before him with his children, pointed a finger at the hunger artist and explained at length what the phenomenon meant, telling storied of earlier years when he himself had watched similar but much more thrilling performances, and the children, still rather uncomprehending, since neither inside nor outside shcool had they been sufficiently prepared for this lesson–what did they care about fasting?–yet showed by the brightnes of their intent eyes that new and better times might be coming. Perhaps, said the hunger artist to himself many a time, things could be a little better if his cage were set not quite so near the menagerie. That made it too easy for people to make their choice, to say nothing of what he suffered from the stench of the menagerie, the animals’ restlessness by night, the carrying past of raw lumps of flesh for the beasts of prey, the roaring at feeding times, which depressed him continuously. But he did not dare to lodge a complaint with the management; after all, he had the animals to thank for the troops of people who passed his cage, among whom there might always be one here and there to take an interest in him, and who could tell where they might seclude him if he called attention to his existence and thereby to the fact that, strictly speaking, he was only an impediment on the wat to the menagerie.</p>
<p>A small impediment, to be sure, one that grew steadily less. People grew familiar with the strange idea that they could be expected, in times like these, to take an interest in a hunger artist, and with this familiarity the verdict went out against him. He might fast as much as he could, and he did so; but nothing could save him now, people passed him by. Just try to explain to anyone the art of fasting! Anyone who has no feeling for it cannot be made to understand it. The fine placards grew dirty and illegible, they were torn down; the little notice board telling the number of fast days achieved, which at first was changed carefully every day, had long stayed at the same figure, for after the first few weeks even this small task seemed pointless to the staff; and so the artist simply fasted on and on, as he had once dreamed of doing, and it was no trouble to him, just as he had always foretold, but no one counted the days, not one, not even the artist himself, knew what records he was already breaking, and his heart grew heavy. And when once in a time some leisurely passer-by stopped, made merry over the old figure on the board and spoke of swindling, that was in its way the stupidest lie ever invented by indifference and inborn malice, since it was not the hunger artist who was cheating, he was working honestly, but the world who was cheating him of his reward.</p>
<p>Many more days went by, however, and that too came to an end. An overseer’s eye fell on the cage one day and he asked the attendants why this perfectly good cage should be left standing there unused with dirty straw inside it; nobody knew, until one man, helped out by the notice board, remembered about the hunger artist. They poked into the straw with sticks and found him in it. “Are you still fasting?” asked the overseer, “when on earth do you mean to stop?” “Forgive me, everybody,” whispered the hunger artist, only the overseer, who had his ear to the bars, understood him. “Of course,” said the overseer, and tapped his forehead with a finger to let the attendants know what state the man was in, “we forgive you.” “I always wanted you to admire my fasting,” said the hunger artist. “We do admire it,” said the overseer, affably. “But you shouldn’t admire it,” said the hunger artist. “Well then we don’t admire it,” said the overseer, “but why shouldn’t we admire it?” “Because I have to fast, I can’t help it,” said the hunger artist. “What a fellow you are,” said the overseer, “and why can’t you help it?” “Because,” said the hunger artist, lifting his head a little and speaking, with his lips pursed, as if for a kiss, right into the overseer’s ear, so that no syllable might be lost, “because I couldn’t find the food I liked. If I had found it, believe me, I should have made no fuss and stuffed myself like you or anyone else.” These were his last words, but in his dimming eyes remained the firm though no longer proud persuasion that he was continuing to fast.</p>
<p>“Well, clear this out now!” said the overseer, and they buried the hunger artist, straw and all. Into the cage they put a young panther. Even the most insensitive felt it refreshing to see this wild creature leaping around the cage that had so long been dreary. The panther was all right. The food he liked was brought him without hesitation by the attendants; he seemed not even to miss his freedom; his noble body, furnished almost to the bursting point with all that it needed, seemed to carry freedom around with it too; somewhere in his jaws it seemed to lurk; and the joy of life streamed with such ardent passion from his throat that for the onlookers it was not easy to stand the shock of it. But they braced themselves, crowded round the cage, and did not want ever to move away.</p>

<p>Rental and resale are both considered to be critical to a circular business model and arbiters of next-generation fashion consumption.

<p>在让大多数奢侈品品牌生意承受沉重打击的新冠疫情期间，Dior 和竞争对手拉开距离、构建品牌护城河，在中国开展新渠道和尝试虚拟试穿科技。</p>
<p>在 Dior 2021高级成衣秋季发布会当天，品牌首席执行官 Pietro Beccari 先生在罗丹美术馆的花园中表示，他对 Dior 自疫情以来举办的第三场线下实体秀感到无比欣喜。Beccari 说：“你可以从我的声音中感受到，这是一个乐观的人才会有的声音，我真的很高兴。”</p>
<p>此前，Dior 已经线上发布了三场时装秀发布，在全球范围内累计 2.49亿观看人次。Beccari 说：“我们预见了疫情的到来并决定（在数字化方面）加速变革。我们在疫情中变得比其他品牌更强大，因为我们有勇气去做其他（品牌）做不到或不敢做的事。”</p>
<p>从不披露旗下单个品牌财务数据的 LVMH 集团指出，Dior 是 2020 年品牌中的 “杰出” 选手，下半年实现了两位数的增长。LVMH 在本月刚刚发布了 2021 年上半年的财务数据，预计 Dior 仍将保持良好的发展势头。</p>
<p>Beccari 将品牌的商业成功归功于几位 “金牌” 创意总监：女装设计师 Maria Grazia Chiuri，男装设计师 Kim Jones 和珠宝设计师 Victoire de la Castellane。他说：“他们的才华让我们的产品总是大受欢迎。”</p>
<p>据投行 Morgan Stanley 估计，Dior 2020 年的销售额超过了 60 亿美元。分析人士补充说，品牌高额的营销支出是推动 Dior 业绩表现出色的主要因素之一。近年来，Dior 的确在宣传上动辄投入巨大，包括频繁且高调的时装秀、艺术展以及围绕产品丰富的创意举措。</p>
<p>Beccari 表示，新颖性是 Dior 数字战略的核心，并把重点放在了融合文化与创新的 “Dior Dream”。疫情期间，品牌在包括微信、TikTok、YouTube 和哔哩哔哩等社交媒体平台上直播和转发了具有高影响力的三场时装秀：与 Travis Scott 在巴黎合作的 2022 春夏男装系列、在雅典 Panathenaic 体育场举办的可容纳 400 人的 Cruise 2022 秀，以及用 350 米长的挂毯为背景的巴黎时装秀。以上三场秀在各个平台上共计获得 2.49 亿次观看，仅抖音上的观看次数就达到了 9200 万。</p>
<p>在新产品的宣传上，Dior 也常常下足功夫，善用名人和 KOL 营销，力图把宣传效果做到最大化。上个月刚刚推出的迷你手袋系列就是一个典型的例子，品牌采用了一整套数字营销策略，围绕产品发布进行数字化创新。Beccari 称，此次产品发布品牌精心制作了幽默的 YouTube 和 TikTok 视频，以及与 Blackpink Jisoo 等品牌大使合作的广告植入。此外，品牌定向邀请了超过 325 名网络影响力人士在他们的社交媒体账号上发布该系列的穿搭示范，共计产生了 900 万美元的媒体参与价值。</p>
<p>根据 <em>Vogue Business</em> 指数报告的分析，Dior 在 Facebook、Instagram、YouTube 和 Google 上的表现在 60 个上榜的奢侈品品牌中位列第一。但 Beccari 认为，Dior 仍需在数字化领域不断努力创新，品牌的存在感、认知度，以及讲故事的能力都需要进一步提升。</p>
<p>他说：“观众所寻求的是更深层次的、具有真正意义的联系，这是植根于身份认同和文化传统的，既鼓舞人心又激发灵感，才能加深消费者对 Dior Dream 的理解和吸引力。”</p>
<p>Beccari 指出，品牌最大的挑战在于如何在激烈的竞争环境中不断发展，尤其是在中国市场。因此，该品牌不断地进行数字化策略的反省和测试，并追求独创性、适用性和敢于冒险的精神。</p>
<p>Beccari 十分勇于尝试新平台，并不把观看和点赞次数作为唯一的追求重点。他说：“现在的人比以前更容易对一个事物产生疲倦感。因此我们必须为他们提供源源不断的创新和惊喜。我们所面临的最大挑战是：如何用创新性和摩登感来弥补和平衡 Dior 的品牌传统和厚重历史。”</p>
<h6 id="通过大胆尝试在中国保持领先地位"><a href="#通过大胆尝试在中国保持领先地位" class="headerlink" title="通过大胆尝试在中国保持领先地位"></a><strong>通过大胆尝试在中国保持领先地位</strong></h6><p>在中国，Dior 本土化的数字化战略有助于品牌扩大受众。Beccari 说：“执着于一个单一的、没有变化可言的品牌形象，便是冒着在层层文化转述中迷失自我的风险，这会降低来自其他文化背景的人识别 Dior 形象的能力。” </p>
<p>Dior 的目标是在不同地区的市场采用不同的数字化战略，比如在日本的 Line 和中国的微信、微博或抖音等本土平台上建立线上消费者社群。据 <em>Vogue Business</em> 指数显示，该品牌目前仍然是微信上搜索量最大的奢侈品品牌，在过去六个月中增长了 30%。到 2021 年为止，Dior 已经在中国直播了 7 场时装秀，观众总数达到 5.79 亿。</p>
<p>Dior 还是首个入驻哔哩哔哩的头部奢侈品品牌，并于 2020 年 7 月在该平台上直播了于意大利 Puglia 区城市 Lecca 举办的 Cruise 2021 时装秀（现场观众名额非常有限）。Beccari 说，虽然正如预期的那样，新平台仅占更成熟的中国平台所产生的 1940 万次观看的一小部分，但 Dior 在社交媒体上获得了年轻人对品牌在哔哩哔哩这样的平台上进行内容尝试的积极反馈。品牌也将继续在哔哩哔哩上产出官方内容和与 KOL 合作的内容。</p>
<p>Beccari 说：“我们并不总是在追热点。满意度是一个重要指标；原创性意味着人们更有可能以积极的方式与品牌进行互动，同时增加观看次数、点赞和评论。谈到覆盖率，我们会查看人们在 Google 上搜索的内容、品牌被提及的方式，当然还有官网的流量。”</p>
<p>根据 <em>Vogue Business</em> 指数，Dior 的官网流量同比增幅最高为 193%，其它品牌的平均值约为 50%。品牌在 Google 上的搜索量也提高了 60%，比 VB 指数平均水平高出四倍。</p>
<p>去年疫情封锁期间，Dior 两次与中国 KOL 合作在微信小程序上直播购物。通过增加中文内容，该品牌加强了与微信、哔哩哔哩等中国本土社交平台的合作。与腾讯的战略合作伙伴关系也正在进一步推进，包括在腾讯视频、微信和 QQ 音乐等平台上产出内容。微信的运营让 Dior 也看到了社交购物的潜力，允许消费者在不离开平台的情况下购买产品。</p>
<h6 id="数字化战略的下一步：虚拟试穿"><a href="#数字化战略的下一步：虚拟试穿" class="headerlink" title="数字化战略的下一步：虚拟试穿"></a><strong>数字化战略的下一步：虚拟试穿</strong></h6><p>Beccari 说，Dior 是最早一批入驻 TikTok 的品牌。“我们不能对新平台视而不见，因为它们具有巨大的潜力，因此我们对它们进行测试和学习。也许我们会继续采用这些平台；也许不会。这是一个持续的过程。”</p>
<p>Tik Tok 在 95 后中的热度是一个重要因素，它娱乐性、非正式的内容将 Dior 包装为一个平易近人、思想开放的奢侈品品牌。“我们非常关注市场的演变和我们的客户获取信息的方式，以及这些信息本身是什么，” Beccari 说到。</p>
<p>被传为数字时尚下一个大趋势的 NFT 又如何？“NFT 是一种新兴趋势，我们正在关注，尽管我们暂时无意参与其中”， Beccari 说。</p>
<p>Dior 接下来的重点是跨平台的 AR 和虚拟试穿，从 B27 运动鞋和 70 周年巡回展配饰，再到 Dior Book Tote 包的个性化定制。Beccari 说：“AR 和虚拟试穿已被证明为是一项宝贵的资产，但只有当它连接到真实的产品时才对我们有意义。在疫情期间，当所有事情都在线上和电话中进行时，我们发现客户喜欢在进入精品店之前先更好地了解产品。”</p>
<p>Beccari 说，虚拟试穿功能是一项具有行业变革意义的科技创新。“一旦人们体验并习惯了它，我们坚信它会成为消费者间的一种标准，虽然目前技术仍然有限，但发展非常迅速。”</p>
<p>Dior 的全渠道能力也在疫情期间得以成熟。Beccari 说，他看到消费者们利用在线购物、线上预约、收藏商品等服务。“我们看到这些服务的采用大幅加速，客户的购买行为迅速改变。有无可辩驳的证据表明，消费者们希望这些新的服务能在疫情结束后继续存在。”</p>
